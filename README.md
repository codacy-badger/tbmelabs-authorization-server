# TBME TV

A free to use streaming application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

All tests will be executed automatically within `mvn package`. This includes Java (JUnit) and JavaScript/React (Karma) tests.

Use `mvn test` to execute the JUnit tests only. Nearly every Maven module includes some test cases.

Both the modules core-server/zuul-entry-server and core-server/authorization-server include frontend tests. Navigate to src/main/webapp and execute `npm run test` to start the Karma tests.

### Break down into end to end tests

## Deployment

You have to install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) before deploying anything. Any attempt to execute `mvn test` without the proper database setup will fail. Login with your root account after the successful installation and execute the following sql-files to create the test users and databases:

* core-server/authorization-server/src/main/resources/db/installation/development/test_database.sql

### .war-files to Tomcat

The default build generates .war-files using Maven. Open a command line and execute `mvn clean install` to generate your copy of the project.

### Docker images

You may run the full application stack on Docker. It is packaged using the [com.spotify.docker-maven-plugin](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.fabric8/docker-maven-plugin). To generate all images execute `mvn clean package docker:build` in the root folder.
