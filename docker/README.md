The `docker-compose.yml` is currently managed as a development helper. It is given that none of the tbme-tv-servers is dockerized and that is why all ports are exposed to the outside world.

Note: Do not miss to change any user, password or given name (e.g. database names) if you're using this docker-composed file in a productive environment. No responsibility taken!
